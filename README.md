# Teacher Externship Sample Project!

Welcome to the Teacher Externship sample React app! This project is designed for educators visiting Google to learn about our work culture and processes, and to help you create engaging materials for your students.

## Project Overview

This app showcases information about the teacher externship and displays a list of attendees. Each teacher will be responsible for creating their own profile component and adding it to the attendee list.

## Getting Started

### Scripts

- **Start development server:**  
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
- **Build for production:**  
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
- **Preview production build:**  
  ```bash
  npm run preview
  ```
- **Run tests:**  
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```
- **Lint code:**  
  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```

### Directory Structure

- `src/components/mini_profile/` â€” Contains attendee profile components.  
  Add your own profile as a new component in this folder and update the attendee list.

## Working in GitHub Codespaces

- **Automatic setup:** Codespaces will automatically install dependencies on first launch.
- **Live preview:** Use the "Ports" tab to preview your running app (`npm run dev`).
- **Integrated terminal:** Run scripts and commands directly in the Codespaces terminal.
- **Editor features:** Take advantage of VS Code features like IntelliSense, debugging, and source control.
- **Testing:** Run and view test results in the integrated terminal or use the Testing sidebar.
